Carbohydrate: -

Step 1 (defining what a carbohydrate is) 

A carbohydrate is form of sugar. Sugar or glucose is one of the simplest forms of carbohydrate.
Starch, like in a potatoe or pastea is one of most complex froms of carbohydrate, made from long chains of glucose molecules.

Glucose is important, it is your bodies preferred source of energy!

Step 2. (Upon noming) (drag and drop the carbs into the mouth, munching sound effects, animate movement to the belly)

Once you have eaten a carbohydrate, your begins breaking it down into the smallest pieces it can. Glucose molcules! This starts happening as soon as it enters your mouth.

All carbohydrates become glucose! (nearly)

Step 3.

Glucose is a small molecule and is easily absorbed into your body in the small intestine. This happens very quickly in foods that have a lot of simple carbohydrates like sweets and fizzy drinks.  It takes much longer with complex carbohydrates taking several hours.

Step 4.
 The pancreas watches your blood for the amount of glucose in it and when it gets to high releases a hormone called insulin. This tells your liver to remove the glucose and store it in long carbohydrate chains called glycogen or pushes it into your muscles for an emergency situation. 

 200 grams is how much glucose a fully grown man can accomodate in his muscles, once it is there it cannot come out and can be only removed through exercise!

 The liver stores 70 grams, this is used up daily 

Step 5. Once both the muscles and the liver are full of glucose, all extra glucose is turned by the body it fat! or adipose tissue!
